# A vite template you probably don't need
A vite template using:
- [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)
- [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)
- [Less CSS](https://lesscss.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

All set up and ready to go.

## What did I do?
I ran `yarn create vite .` and chose the preact-ts template.

Then installed Tailwind with [this guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite) and `less`.

## Using this
1. Remove `.git` so my commits don't show up in your codebase.
2. Alter `LICENSE` because it is probably not the one you want.
3. Alter this README because people will be confused if they see this text instead of your project's description
4. Fix the `package.json` to have your license and names.
4. `git init`

Done
